# CG1(CS171) @ ShanghaiTech
 Real time particle collision simulation solution in Unity, based on Unity CJLib

Later on note:
We didn't finish it to fully functional rigidbody level at last, since our time was so limited in the course. It's not physically accurate as well, but you are welcome to download if you want to see some trivial compute shader examples.

# Note from 2025
This is a student project I made a while ago and it's severely outdated. You can probably find better things to learn compute shaders.
(Actually CJLib itself is better!)
